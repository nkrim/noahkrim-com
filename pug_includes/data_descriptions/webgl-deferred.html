    Intended as a renderer for a 3D puzzle game engine, this renderer supports
    advanced exponential variance shadow-mapping (EVSM) for dynamic lightsources,
    screen-space anti-aliasing (FXAA), screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO),
    physically-based rendered lighting (PBR), and Source-inpsired room-isolated 
    rendering logic with a graph of room connections to support
    efficient culling of both rendered meshes and light interactions.

    The goal was to make a 3D engine with some high-quality rendering features that can be
    tuned to support a wide variety of devices. Since this is running on the web,
    it needed to remain efficient and performant even at its base level, while
    also remaining flexible enoguh to support low-end hardware,
    such as computers with only integrated graphics, if necessary.
