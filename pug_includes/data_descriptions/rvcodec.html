    A webapp that helps students visualize how RISC-V instructions are encoded
    and decoded.
    Can either encode or decode the input and presents a visualization of the
    fields of the assembly instruction and how they map to the bits in the
    encoded instruction word.

    Aa a contributor to this project, I made the following contributions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Expanded the core encoder/decoder from just the base RV32I to support
        all ratified extensions in RV32/64/128GC.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed bugs and normalized conventions in the core to make it more consistent
        and maintainable.
    </li>
    <li>
        Implemented the autocomplete/lookup feature in the input field using
        a custom prefix trie and a system to map instructions to their
        operand format.
    </li>
</ul>
