    A simple ray-tracing engine designed to test the performance improvement of
    CUDA for this particular workload. The scene consists of a variable number of
    randomly placed reflective spheres. The engine performs scattering and
    accumulation to create a high quality image in real-time by improving fidelity
    across frames.

    CUDA parallelization is done at the level of areas of pixels in the rendered frame.
    We test the assumption that each pixel within these small areas will processs a
    similar number of ray bounces and access similar memory from the scene.
    These factors will promote speedup.
    This approach is tested against a serial implementation for
    increasingly many spheres to show improvements from CUDA
    as the scene grows more complex.
