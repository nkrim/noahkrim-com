<p>
    An interactive Mandelbrot fractal explorer with frame contents entirely
    generated from hand-written MASM assembly code using AVX SIMD instructions
    for performance.
    Uses SFML as a window manager and input controller, but all commands are
    sent to the assembly rendering library which generates the pixel data to be rendered.

<p>
    Supports zooming, panning, adjusting fractal precision, and multiple coloring modes.
