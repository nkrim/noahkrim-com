    This game puts you in seat of a 1984-style beauracrat who is having their
    thoughts constantly analyzed by their government to ensure complacency.
    However, you are given the ability to continue thinking freely, as long as
    you can rearrange your thoughts back into obediency before they are checked.
    Use this freedom to sabotage infrastructure and remain innocuous.
