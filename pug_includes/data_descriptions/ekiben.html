    This site allows users to go on a quick eploration of the regionally-distinct
    <i>ekiben</i>, bento found at Japanese train stations intended to be eaten
    while riding the train.
    You can select a variety of cities and investigate the ingredients and history
    of a selected ekiben specific to that region.

    One interesting engineering problem was how to allow selection and highlighting
    of specific areas of the images. This was done by manually rotoscoping these
    sections in photoshop while also generating a mask of that specific area.
    While the rotoscoped image is used for the highlighitng, the masks are
    composited these into a single image while, ensuring each area has a distinct
    shade of red representing the area's ID.
    There are actually two rendered canvases on the site, one of which is invisible
    and displays this ID mask. I can then use the user's mouse position to query
    this mask and highlight the associated area of the image.
