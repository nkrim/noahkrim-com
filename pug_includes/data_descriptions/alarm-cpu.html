    alARM is a simple ARM-like ISA used an assignment for the UC Davis
    computer architecture course.
</p>
<p>
    The assignment specified a digital logic simulation of an alARM CPU
    to be made in the program Logisim. The design and implementation of this
    CPU is documented in the whitepaper linked below.
</p>
<p>
    The original assignment required hand-assembling programs into the bytecode
    so that it could be loaded into Logisim.
    As a student in the class, I volunteered to write an assembler for the rest
    of the class to use to speed up this tedious process.
    The assembler includes a choice of strict or relaxed syntaxes, highly
    informative error messages, and pseudo-instructions.
    You can see a full specification of the assembly syntax in the assembler's README.
</p>
<p>
    The assembler was written to gracefully handle the addition of new
    instructions and pseudo-instructions -- this proved useful when
    students in future iterations of the class forked and easily updated the
    assembler for new project specifications.
