    A lineage-based transactional database written in Rust with a python interface.
    This kind of database stores the changes in records after each transaction,
    retaining the history of the record within the managed structure of the
    database.
    Indirection is limited by maintaining a chain of references from a base
    record -- the record attached to the query structures -- and the tail record
    -- the most recent version of the record.
    Then the chain continues backwards in time all the way back to the base record.
    Supports multithreaded query scheduling with concurrency control,
    durable buffer pool, and variable-sized data elements.

    Developed by a five-person team, my responsibilites and contributions include:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Record location</b> system that encodes both the logical range index
            and the physical page and offset of the record's content all in one value.
            This eases the query system by coupling this logical and physical info in a packed value.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Durable buffer pool</b> acts as the interface between the file-system and the
            database server's memory. Caches pages and allows multiple-reader single-writer
            access to these cached pages. Writes dirty pages back to file-system on eviction.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Concurrency control</b> procedure acting primarily on the buffer pool,
            as this is the main point of contention. Ensures every transaction is able
            to complete in isolation without being affected by other transactions,
            all while minimizing redundant buffer frame evictions.
        </li>
    </ul>
