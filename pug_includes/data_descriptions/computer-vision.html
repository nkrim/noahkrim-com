    <b>Image stitching</b> presents a procedure to stitch together images to form
    a cohesive panoramic photo, compensating for differences in camera angle and position.
    Harris corner detection is used to find a set of useful descriptors in the
    images and then find good pairs of descriptors that may act as anchor points
    to match up the images. Finally, RANSAC is used to randomly sample a set of
    pairs and attempts a homographic projection built upon those points. This
    leads to an almost exact reprojection of the contents of one image into the
    space of the other.

    <b>Filters and edge detection</b> contains a variety of experiments with
    different kernel filters such as Gaussian blur, Sobel edge detection, and
    bilateral filter. This culminates in an algorithm using the Hough transform
    to create a set of lines that can characterize the most significant edges
    of the image.
