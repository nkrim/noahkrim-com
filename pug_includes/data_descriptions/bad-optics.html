    Look familiar? This website was made for an art collective I created with
    a few of my friends.
    I really enjoyed the design -- and I spent a lot of time on it back then --
    so I decided to reuse it for this personal website.

    The goal was to have one website from which we could all share our creations,
    which could implicitly diffuse one member's marketing to the others.
    The design of the website was supposed to reflect a minimal, dark, and
    modern aesthetic with a technical bend to it.
    I wanted a website that felt hand-made and detail oriented, so a bulk of the
    time was spent on making all of the interactions smooth and substantial.
    Besides some jquery for easy element lookups and filtering, there are
    no libraries or frameworks used; just good old-fashioned vanilla javascript.
</p>

    The collective was multimedia, so I contributed a game and had planned to
    develop more along with the website. There is also an art gallery with
    pieces made by another member but was thoughtfully arranged on the website
    with the browser as a viewing medium in mind. There were even plans to make
    a 3D gallery, which is where the WebGL deferred renderer comes in, but
    those plans fell through.
