<p>
    A cloth simulation built with OpenGL and SFML for the UI.
    Supports a variety of options to customize the aesthetics of the mesh and
    the quality of the simulation.
</p>
<p>
    Supports mouse interaction with the mesh via direct manipulation of mesh nodes
    via dragging, pinning, or deletion.
<p>
    Simulation is implemented with Verlet integration to propogate the forces
    while preventing erroneous increases in system energy and the mesh is constructed
    with constraints on edge that are iteratively resolved to stabilize the results.
    The rendered mesh is itself interpolated at a higher resolution than the simulation mesh,
    efficiently improving the apperance of the simulation.
