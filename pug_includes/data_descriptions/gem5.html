    Over the Summer of 2024, was a hired as a research software engineer in the
    UC Davis DArchR lab that maintains and develops gem5.
    During that time, I made the following contributions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Resolved longstanding issues affecting KVM workloads by developing a Linux
        Kernel driver guest-to-host bridge. Allows unprivileged programs on simulated OS
        guests to communicate with the gem5 simulator via MMIO accesses.
    </li>
    <li>
        Developed a new simulation object framework for accelerator development.
        Automates the scheduling of internal events, allowing users to focus on design.
    </li>
    <li>
        Aided in the development, editing, and testing of educational materials for the
        2024 gem5 Bootcamp. Built key features of the bootcampâ€™s website.
    </li>
</ul>
