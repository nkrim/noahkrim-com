    A problem-solving game inspired by Zachtronics and digital logic.
    Abanoned as a prototype due to my own inability to explain the mechanics,
    I left it as "purposefully" inpenetrable in order to inspire the rare
    few to discover its functionality (inspired by games like
    <a href="https://games.increpare.com/Gestalt_OS/" target="_blank">Gestalt-OS</a>).

    Each tile can contain a logic module and can be linked with wires between the modules.
    Each tile can also be customized to interact with different signals or to
    react in different ways (toggling, rotating, etc) when a signal is emitted.
    Signals can be emitted by having power sent to themvia the wires,
    and recievers can react to the emission of a signal by transmitting power themselves.
    The goal is to emit a certain combination of signals in series in a reproducible manner.

    Made with the cross-platform haxe language and the haxegon game framework which
    was primarily used for the rendering API. The bulk of the game's architecture
    and logic was handmade.
    The game simulation is highly performant and could run tens of hundreds of thousands
    of iterations per second from a dense and complicated circuit (though neither
    that complexity nor that speed is at all necessary for the game).
