    Annual programming contest hosted at UC Davis with a focus on introducing
    both undergrads and highschool students to the creative thinking and
    problem solving skills that competitive programming promotes.

    I was lead problem setter for the 2023 and 2024 contests and a problem
    writer/tester for the upcoming 2025 contest.
    As lead problem setter, I was responsible for statement editting,
    testing/verification, and maintaining format consistency.
    I also led onboarding efforts to instruct and advise other members of the
    contest organization team in terms of problem writing and configuring the judge.
